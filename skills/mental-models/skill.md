## List Available Models

Before calling any script, resolve the scripts directory (version may vary):
```bash
MM="$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/*/skills/mental-models/scripts ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/*/*/skills/mental-models/scripts ~/.claude/skills/mental-models/scripts .claude/skills/mental-models/scripts 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)"
```

Then use the script to browse and search models:

```bash
# List all 54 models grouped by volume
$MM/list-models.sh

# Filter by volume (1-4)
$MM/list-models.sh --volume 1

# Search by keyword
$MM/list-models.sh --search "thinking"

# Quick count
$MM/list-models.sh --count
```

**Volumes:**

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Identify the Problem Category

Ask yourself:

- Is this about **understanding** something? → Volume 1 models
- Is this about **change/energy/adaptation**? → Volume 2 models
- Is this about **systems/patterns**? → Volume 3 models
- Is this about **value/communication**? → Volume 4 models

### Step 2: Select 2-3 Relevant Models

Don't use just one model. Combine multiple perspectives:

- Start with First Principles to understand the core
- Use Inversion to identify what to avoid
- Apply Second-Order Thinking to check consequences

### Step 3: Apply and Iterate

1. State the problem clearly
2. Apply each selected model
3. Look for conflicts between model outputs
4. Synthesize into actionable insight

### Example: Should I take this new job?

**First Principles:** What do I fundamentally want from work? (income, growth, meaning, flexibility)

**Second-Order Thinking:**

- 1st order: Higher salary
- 2nd order: More stress, less time for family
- 3rd order: Possible burnout, career reset needed

**Inversion:** What would make this job the worst decision? Long commute, toxic culture, dead-end role → Check if these exist

**Opportunity Cost:** What am I giving up? Current relationships, learning trajectory, unvested equity

**Circle of Competence:** Am I qualified, or will I be struggling outside my expertise?

## Mental Model Combinations

### For Problem Diagnosis

1. Map is Not the Territory → Check if you understand reality
2. First Principles → Break down to fundamentals
3. Circle of Competence → Assess your ability to judge

### For Decision Making

1. Second-Order Thinking → Trace consequences
2. Inversion → Identify failure modes
3. Probabilistic Thinking → Estimate likelihoods
4. Margin of Safety → Add buffer

### For System Design

1. Feedback Loops → Design self-correction
2. Bottlenecks → Identify constraints
3. Emergence → Expect unexpected behaviors
4. Gall's Law → Start simple

### For Growth/Scaling

1. Compounding → Think long-term
2. Leverage → Find force multipliers
3. Diminishing Returns → Know when to stop
4. Critical Mass → Aim for tipping point

## Quick Reference Card

### The Top 10 Most Useful Models

1. **First Principles** - Break it down to fundamentals
2. **Second-Order Thinking** - Think ahead: "And then what?"
3. **Inversion** - Avoid failure instead of chasing success
4. **Feedback Loops** - Understand cause and effect cycles
5. **Compounding** - Small consistent actions win long-term
6. **Margin of Safety** - Always have a buffer
7. **Opportunity Cost** - Consider what you're giving up
8. **Leverage** - Find maximum impact points
9. **Hanlon's Razor** - Assume incompetence, not malice
10. **Circle of Competence** - Know your limits

### Daily Checklist

Before any major decision, ask:

- [ ] Am I reasoning from first principles or by analogy?
- [ ] What are the second and third-order effects?
- [ ] What would I do if I wanted this to fail? (Inversion)
- [ ] What's the probability of success? What's my confidence level?
- [ ] What am I giving up by choosing this? (Opportunity Cost)
- [ ] Do I have adequate margin of safety?
- [ ] Is this within my circle of competence?
