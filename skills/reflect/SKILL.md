# Reflect

**Purpose**: Turn transient learnings into permanent improvements. What separates growth from stagnation is the ability to learn from experience.

## Core Principles

1. **AI-First Analysis**: Don't programmatically detect patterns - let AI understand context, nuance, and intent
2. **Rule Violation Priority**: Strengthen violated rules before adding new ones (fewer, stronger rules > many weak rules)
3. **Skill Extraction Selectivity**: Only extract knowledge that is reusable, non-trivial, and verified
4. **Delta Updates**: Make incremental, targeted changes - never rewrite entire files
5. **Processed Tracking**: Track analyzed sessions to avoid re-analysis

## Quick Start

Run from the skill directory (`~/.claude/skills/reflect/` or wherever installed):

```bash
# Extract last 5 sessions with diary summary
bun run scripts/extract-session.ts <project-path> --last 5 --diary

# Full extraction with thinking blocks
bun run scripts/extract-session.ts <project-path> --last 5 --verbose

# JSON output for further processing
bun run scripts/extract-session.ts <project-path> --last 5 --json
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Setup

1. Create todo list for tracking progress
2. Get target project path (or use current directory)
3. Verify sessions exist:
   ```bash
   bun run scripts/get-project-path.ts <path> --check
   ```
4. Check for unprocessed sessions:
   ```bash
   # Compare sessions in project folder with memory/processed.json
   ```
5. Load existing CLAUDE.md rules (for violation detection)
6. Ask user how many sessions to analyze (default: 5)

### Phase 2: Extract Sessions

```bash
bun run scripts/extract-session.ts <project-folder> --last N --verbose
```

Output includes:

- Session metadata (date, duration, branch)
- Diary summary (task, files modified, work items)
- Full conversation with tool calls and results
- Thinking blocks (with --verbose)
- Skills and agents used
- Session statistics

### Phase 3: Analyze (AI does this)

Read the extracted sessions holistically. Let AI identify what matters - don't use keyword detection or bias towards "corrections".

**Core Question**: What knowledge from these sessions is **reusable** and can **evolve**?

**A. Check Rule Violations**

Compare session with existing CLAUDE.md rules:

- Was any existing rule violated?
- If yes → **Strengthen the rule first** (don't add new)

**B. Find Friction Points**

Detect patterns where user repeatedly has to:

- Remind AI of something every session
- Manually do something AI should handle
- Correct the same type of mistake
- Explain the same context again

Ask: What would make this friction disappear?

**C. Discover Preferences**

Patterns the user consistently shows across sessions:

- Tools/skills they always use or request
- Approaches they consistently prefer
- Implicit expectations made explicit through repetition

Only worth capturing if it appears **multiple times** across sessions.

**D. Extract Reusable Knowledge**

AI should freely identify knowledge that:

- **Repeats across sessions** - patterns, not one-off incidents
- **Can evolve** - builds upon existing knowledge
- **Is generalizable** - applies beyond this specific context

Skip:

- Context-specific corrections (already handled in the moment)
- One-time fixes (no reuse value)
- Things already obvious or in docs

**E. Evaluate Skill Candidates (Selective)**

Criteria for extracting a skill:

- [ ] Required >10 minutes investigation
- [ ] Solution was non-obvious (not just docs lookup)
- [ ] Has specific trigger conditions (error messages, symptoms)
- [ ] Solution was verified to work
- [ ] Would help someone facing same problem in future
- [ ] Doesn't duplicate existing skills/docs

Types of extractable knowledge:

- Non-obvious debugging techniques
- Error patterns where message was misleading
- Workarounds discovered through trial-and-error
- Configuration insights not in official docs
- Patterns specific to codebase or tech stack

### Phase 4: Synthesize

Present findings in structured format:

```markdown
## Reflection: [Project Name]

Analyzed [N] sessions from [date range]

### Rule Violations (if any)

- **Rule**: [existing rule text]
- **What happened**: [brief description]
- **Action**: Strengthen → [proposed new text]

### Friction Points

1. **Pattern**: [what user repeatedly has to do]
   **Frequency**: [how often across sessions]
   **Solution**: [what would eliminate this friction]

### Preferences

1. **Preference**: [what user consistently does/requests]
   **Evidence**: [sessions where this appeared]

### Reusable Knowledge

1. **Knowledge**: [what was learned]
   **Why reusable**: [how it applies beyond this session]

### Skill Candidates

1. **Problem**: [what problem this solves]
   **Trigger**: [when to use]
   **Worth creating?**: [Yes/No + reasoning]

### Proposed Changes

#### CLAUDE.md Updates

**Change**: [add/modify/strengthen]
**Text**: [exact text]
**Rationale**: [why this helps future sessions]

#### New Skills

[For each proposed skill]

**Name**: [kebab-case-name]
**Problem**: [one-line description]
**Trigger**: [error messages, symptoms]
**Evidence**: [session quote]
```

### Phase 5: Apply (with approval)

**IMPORTANT: Never create or modify files without explicit user approval.**

**Step 1: Ask which changes to apply**

Present all proposed changes and ask:
"Which of these should I apply?"

Options:

- "all" - apply everything
- "1, 3, 5" - apply specific items by number
- "none" - cancel
- "just CLAUDE.md" / "just skills" - filter by type

**Step 2: Apply CLAUDE.md updates**

For rule violations (strengthen existing):

1. Read current CLAUDE.md
2. Find the violated rule
3. Strengthen it (don't add new rule)
4. Show diff for confirmation

For new rules:

1. Read current CLAUDE.md
2. Add new rules at appropriate location
3. Show diff for confirmation

**Step 3: Create skills (if approved)**

1. Research best practices (web search) if technology-specific
2. Use skill template (below)
3. Show full skill content for review
4. Ask: "Confirm creation?"
5. Create file only after confirmation

**Step 4: Mark sessions as processed**

Update `memory/processed.json`:

```json
{
  "sessions": {
    "session-id": {
      "project": "/path/to/project",
      "processedAt": "2026-01-18T12:00:00Z",
      "learningsApplied": 3
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 5: Write diary entry (optional)**

If user wants, save reflection to `memory/diary/YYYY-MM-DD-reflection.md`

## Quality Criteria

**Before strengthening a rule:**

- [ ] Rule was actually violated (has evidence)
- [ ] Strengthening makes it clearer/more prominent
- [ ] Won't conflict with other rules

**Before adding a new CLAUDE.md rule:**

- [ ] Based on actual evidence from sessions (has quote)
- [ ] Not already covered by existing rules
- [ ] Specific enough to be actionable
- [ ] Prevents a real problem that occurred
- [ ] Won't add unnecessary friction

**Before creating a new Skill:**

- [ ] Knowledge is reusable (not one-time fix)
- [ ] Solution required discovery (not just docs lookup)
- [ ] Has specific trigger conditions (error messages, symptoms)
- [ ] Solution has been verified to work
- [ ] Doesn't duplicate existing skills or official docs
- [ ] Would help future sessions facing same problem

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Over-extraction**: Not every session deserves a skill
2. **Vague rules**: "Be more careful" doesn't help
3. **Duplicate rules**: Check existing rules first
4. **Unverified solutions**: Only extract what actually worked
5. **Re-analyzing**: Check processed.json before analyzing
6. **Batch changes**: Apply changes incrementally, confirm each

## Tips

1. **Start small**: Analyze 3-5 sessions first
2. **Read thinking blocks**: They reveal assumptions
3. **Focus on reusability**: Knowledge that applies beyond this session
4. **Be specific**: "Always use bun instead of npm" > "Be flexible with tools"
5. **Strengthen first**: Violated rule? Make it stronger, don't add new
6. **Delta updates**: Change only what's needed, preserve structure
7. **Track progress**: Use todo list throughout
8. **Verify before extract**: Only extract skills that were proven to work
